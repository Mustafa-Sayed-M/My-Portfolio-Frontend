# 🎨 Portfolio Frontend (React + Vite)

This is the **frontend** part of my personal portfolio, built using **React**, **Vite**, and **TailwindCSS**, and connected to a **serverless backend** hosted on **Vercel** with MongoDB.

It’s fast, animated, and mobile responsive — showcasing projects, skills, services, and contact information.
